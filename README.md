FC Football United 

I'm plotting the passes for fictional team FC Football United. I used the Soccer Event Logger created by Ben Torvaney. 
You can use his logger at https://torvaney.github.io/projects/tracker 
Check it out! 

I was able to pull the coordinates for the game after plotting them on the logger. Once I downloaded the data in a csv I
used the mplsoccer package to plot out the passes and create the heat map. The heat map represents the end 
location of all the successful passes. If given to a coach at half time, it would be good information to half so they can
adjust their team accordingly.

Thank You!
